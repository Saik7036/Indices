**Sentinel-2 Image Analysis with Google Earth Engine and GeoMap**
Introduction :
  This code demonstrates a simple image analysis workflow using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and GeeMap library in Python. The workflow includes fetching Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, filtering based on date and location, masking clouds, calculating NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and visualizing the results on an interactive map.

Requirements :
  Google Earth Engine Python API
  GeeMap library
  Jupyter Notebook environment
  
Usage :
Install the required libraries by running !pip install geemap and setting up Google Earth Engine API.
Copy and paste the provided code into a Jupyter Notebook.
Authenticate Google Earth Engine by uncommenting and running the ee.Authenticate() and ee.Initialize() lines in the code.
Update the Area of Interest (AOI) coordinates to the desired region.
Run the code cells sequentially to retrieve, process, and visualize the Sentinel-2 imagery.
Code Structure
Cell 1: Import necessary libraries.
Cell 2: Authenticate Google Earth Engine and initialize GeoMap.
Cell 3: Define functions for cloud masking and NDVI calculation.
Cell 4: Define the Area of Interest (AOI).
Cell 5: Filter Sentinel-2 data, apply functions, and calculate NDVI.
Cell 6: Set visualization parameters for RGB image and NDVI.
Cell 7: Add layers to the map, set the map center, and display the map.

Note :
Ensure that you have the required libraries installed and properly authenticated with Google Earth Engine before running the code.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs or integrate it into a larger analysis pipeline. For more information about Google Earth Engine and GeoMap, refer to their respective documentation.

Happy coding!
